# Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster
A basic machine learning project. Logistic Regression algorithm is used to predict the no.of passengers survived in the titanic disaster.

This program can be executed via the jupyter labs.
Open the main program with the .ipynb extension in jupyter lab.

The 5 steps of a ML program is applied:
1. Data collection
2. Analyzing the data
3. Data Wrangling (Data cleaning)
4. Train and Test the data
5. Accuracy Check

The "Result.csv" file is the prediction made by the main program, for the "test.csv" dataset.
The accuracy may change everytime.
